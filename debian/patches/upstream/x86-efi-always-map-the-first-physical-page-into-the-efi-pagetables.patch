Subject: x86/efi: Always map the first physical page into the EFI pagetables

From: Jiri Kosina <jkosina@suse.cz>

commit bf29bddf0417a4783da3b24e8c9e017ac649326f upstream.

Commit:

  129766708 ("x86/efi: Only map RAM into EFI page tables if in mixed-mode")

stopped creating 1:1 mappings for all RAM, when running in native 64-bit mode.

It turns out though that there are 64-bit EFI implementations in the wild
(this particular problem has been reported on a Lenovo Yoga 710-11IKB),
which still make use of the first physical page for their own private use,
even though they explicitly mark it EFI_CONVENTIONAL_MEMORY in the memory
map.

In case there is no mapping for this particular frame in the EFI pagetables,
as soon as firmware tries to make use of it, a triple fault occurs and the
system reboots (in case of the Yoga 710-11IKB this is very early during bootup).

Fix that by always mapping the first page of physical memory into the EFI
pagetables. We're free to hand this page to the BIOS, as trim_bios_range()
will reserve the first page and isolate it away from memory allocators anyway.

Note that just reverting 129766708 alone is not enough on v4.9-rc1+ to fix the
regression on affected hardware, as this commit:

   ab72a27da ("x86/efi: Consolidate region mapping logic")

later made the first physical frame not to be mapped anyway.
