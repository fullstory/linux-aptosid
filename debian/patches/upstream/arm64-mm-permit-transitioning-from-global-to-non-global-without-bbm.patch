Subject: [Variant 3/Meltdown] arm64: mm: Permit transitioning from Global to Non-Global without BBM

From: Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>


Commit 4e6020565596 upstream.

Break-before-make is not needed when transitioning from Global to
Non-Global mappings, provided that the contiguous hint is not being used.
