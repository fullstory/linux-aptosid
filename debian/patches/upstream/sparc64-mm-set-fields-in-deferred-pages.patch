Subject: sparc64/mm: set fields in deferred pages

From: Pavel Tatashin <pasha.tatashin@oracle.com>


[ Upstream commit 2a20aa171071a334d80c4e5d5af719d8374702fc ]

Without deferred struct page feature (CONFIG_DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT),
flags and other fields in "struct page"es are never changed prior to
first initializing struct pages by going through __init_single_page().

With deferred struct page feature enabled there is a case where we set
some fields prior to initializing:

mem_init() {
     register_page_bootmem_info();
     free_all_bootmem();
     ...
}

When register_page_bootmem_info() is called only non-deferred struct
pages are initialized.  But, this function goes through some reserved
pages which might be part of the deferred, and thus are not yet
initialized.

mem_init
register_page_bootmem_info
register_page_bootmem_info_node
 get_page_bootmem
  .. setting fields here ..
  such as: page->freelist = (void *)type;

free_all_bootmem()
free_low_memory_core_early()
 for_each_reserved_mem_region()
  reserve_bootmem_region()
   init_reserved_page() <- Only if this is deferred reserved page
    __init_single_pfn()
     __init_single_page()
      memset(0) <-- Loose the set fields here

We end up with similar issue as in the previous patch, where currently
we do not observe problem as memory is zeroed.  But, if flag asserts are
changed we can start hitting issues.

Also, because in this patch series we will stop zeroing struct page
memory during allocation, we must make sure that struct pages are
properly initialized prior to using them.

The deferred-reserved pages are initialized in free_all_bootmem().
Therefore, the fix is to switch the above calls.
