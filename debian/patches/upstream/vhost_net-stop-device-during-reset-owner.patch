Subject: vhost_net: stop device during reset owner

From: Jason Wang <jasowang@redhat.com>


[ Upstream commit 4cd879515d686849eec5f718aeac62a70b067d82 ]

We don't stop device before reset owner, this means we could try to
serve any virtqueue kick before reset dev->worker. This will result a
warn since the work was pending at llist during owner resetting. Fix
this by stopping device during owner reset.
