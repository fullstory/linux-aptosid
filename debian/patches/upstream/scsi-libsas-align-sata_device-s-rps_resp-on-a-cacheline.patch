Subject: scsi: libsas: align sata_device's rps_resp on a cacheline

From: Huacai Chen <chenhc@lemote.com>

commit c2e8fbf908afd81ad502b567a6639598f92c9b9d upstream.

The rps_resp buffer in ata_device is a DMA target, but it isn't
explicitly cacheline aligned. Due to this, adjacent fields can be
overwritten with stale data from memory on non-coherent architectures.
As a result, the kernel is sometimes unable to communicate with an SATA
device behind a SAS expander.

Fix this by ensuring that the rps_resp buffer is cacheline aligned.

This issue is similar to that fixed by Commit 84bda12af31f93 ("libata:
align ap->sector_buf") and Commit 4ee34ea3a12396f35b26 ("libata: Align
ata_device's id on a cacheline").
