Subject: [Variant 3/Meltdown] arm64: mm: Temporarily disable ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN

From: Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>


Commit 376133b7edc2 upstream.

We're about to rework the way ASIDs are allocated, switch_mm is
implemented and low-level kernel entry/exit is handled, so keep the
ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN code out of the way whilst we do the heavy lifting.

It will be re-enabled in a subsequent patch.
