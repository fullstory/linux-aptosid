Subject: [Variant 2/Spectre-v2] arm64: KVM: Increment PC after handling an SMC trap

From: Marc Zyngier <marc.zyngier@arm.com>


Commit f5115e8869e1 upstream.

When handling an SMC trap, the "preferred return address" is set
to that of the SMC, and not the next PC (which is a departure from
the behaviour of an SMC that isn't trapped).

Increment PC in the handler, as the guest is otherwise forever
stuck...
