Subject: tcp: when rearming RTO, if RTO time is in past then fire RTO ASAP

From: Neal Cardwell <ncardwell@google.com>


[ Upstream commit cdbeb633ca71a02b7b63bfeb94994bf4e1a0b894 ]

In some situations tcp_send_loss_probe() can realize that it's unable
to send a loss probe (TLP), and falls back to calling tcp_rearm_rto()
to schedule an RTO timer. In such cases, sometimes tcp_rearm_rto()
realizes that the RTO was eligible to fire immediately or at some
point in the past (delta_us <= 0). Previously in such cases
tcp_rearm_rto() was scheduling such "overdue" RTOs to happen at now +
icsk_rto, which caused needless delays of hundreds of milliseconds
(and non-linear behavior that made reproducible testing
difficult). This commit changes the logic to schedule "overdue" RTOs
ASAP, rather than at now + icsk_rto.

Fixes: 6ba8a3b19e76 ("tcp: Tail loss probe (TLP)")
