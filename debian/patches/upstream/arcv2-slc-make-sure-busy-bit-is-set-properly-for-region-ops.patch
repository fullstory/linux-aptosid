Subject: ARCv2: SLC: Make sure busy bit is set properly for region ops

From: Alexey Brodkin <abrodkin@synopsys.com>

commit b37174d95b0251611a80ef60abf03752e9d66d67 upstream.

c70c473396cb "ARCv2: SLC: Make sure busy bit is set properly on SLC flushing"
fixes problem for entire SLC operation where the problem was initially
caught. But given a nature of the issue it is perfectly possible for
busy bit to be read incorrectly even when region operation was started.

So extending initial fix for regional operation as well.
