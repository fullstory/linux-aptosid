Subject: perf header: Fix use of unitialized value warning

[ Upstream commit 20f9781f491360e7459c589705a2e4b1f136bee9 ]

When building our local version of perf with MSAN (Memory Sanitizer) and
running the perf record command, MSAN throws a use of uninitialized
value warning in "tools/perf/util/util.c:333:6".

This warning stems from the "buf" variable being passed into "write".
It originated as the variable "ev" with the type union perf_event*
defined in the "perf_event__synthesize_attr" function in
"tools/perf/util/header.c".

In the "perf_event__synthesize_attr" function they allocate space with a malloc
call using ev, then go on to only assign some of the member variables before
passing "ev" on as a parameter to the "process" function therefore "ev"
contains uninitialized memory. Changing the malloc call to zalloc to initialize
all the members of "ev" which gets rid of the warning.

To reproduce this warning, build perf by running:
make -C tools/perf CLANG=1 CC=clang EXTRA_CFLAGS="-fsanitize=memory\
 -fsanitize-memory-track-origins"

(Additionally, llvm might have to be installed and clang might have to
be specified as the compiler - export CC=/usr/bin/clang)

then running:
tools/perf/perf record -o - ls / | tools/perf/perf --no-pager annotate\
 -i - --stdio

Please see the cover letter for why false positive warnings may be
generated.
