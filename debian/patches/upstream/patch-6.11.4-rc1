+ * Example:

+ *
+ * INITIATOR passes through NAT/PAT ("us") and SNAT is done (saddr rewrite).

+ *
+ * This will not work if the SNAT done earlier has same IP:PORT source pair.

+ * Conntrack table has:
+ * ORIGINAL: $IP_INITIATOR:$SPORT -> $IP_RESPONDER:$DPORT
+ * REPLY:    $IP_RESPONDER:$DPORT -> $IP_NAT:$SPORT
+ *
+ * and new locally originating connection wants:

+ * REPLY:    $IP_RESPONDER:$DPORT -> $IP_NAT:$SPORT
