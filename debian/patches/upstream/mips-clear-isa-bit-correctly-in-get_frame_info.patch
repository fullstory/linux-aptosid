Subject: MIPS: Clear ISA bit correctly in get_frame_info()

From: Paul Burton <paul.burton@imgtec.com>

commit ccaf7caf2c73c6db920772bf08bf1d47b2170634 upstream.

get_frame_info() can be called in microMIPS kernels with the ISA bit
already clear. For example this happens when unwind_stack_by_address()
is called because we begin with a PC that has the ISA bit set & subtract
the (odd) offset from the preceding symbol (which does not have the ISA
bit set). Since get_frame_info() unconditionally subtracts 1 from the PC
in microMIPS kernels it incorrectly misaligns the address it then
attempts to access code at, leading to an address error exception.

Fix this by using msk_isa16_mode() to clear the ISA bit, which allows
get_frame_info() to function regardless of whether it is provided with a
PC that has the ISA bit set or not.
