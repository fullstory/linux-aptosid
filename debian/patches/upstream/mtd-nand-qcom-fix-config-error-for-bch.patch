Subject: mtd: nand: qcom: fix config error for BCH

From: Abhishek Sahu <absahu@codeaurora.org>

commit 10777de570016471fd929869c7830a7772893e39 upstream.

The configuration for BCH is not correct in the current driver.
The ECC_CFG_ECC_DISABLE bit defines whether to enable or disable the
BCH ECC in which

	0x1 : BCH_DISABLED
	0x0 : BCH_ENABLED

But currently host->bch_enabled is being assigned to BCH_DISABLED.
