Subject: can: kvaser_usb: cancel urb on -EPIPE and -EPROTO

From: Martin Kelly <mkelly@xevo.com>

commit 6aa8d5945502baf4687d80de59b7ac865e9e666b upstream.

In mcba_usb, we have observed that when you unplug the device, the driver will
endlessly resubmit failing URBs, which can cause CPU stalls. This issue
is fixed in mcba_usb by catching the codes seen on device disconnect
(-EPIPE and -EPROTO).

This driver also resubmits in the case of -EPIPE and -EPROTO, so fix it
in the same way.
