Subject: batman-adv: Detect missing primaryif during tp_send as error

From: Sven Eckelmann <sven@narfation.org>

commit e13258f38e927b61cdb5f4ad25309450d3b127d1 upstream.

The throughput meter detects different situations as problems for the
current test. It stops the test after these and reports it to userspace.
This also has to be done when the primary interface disappeared during the
test.

Fixes: 33a3bb4a3345 ("batman-adv: throughput meter implementation")
