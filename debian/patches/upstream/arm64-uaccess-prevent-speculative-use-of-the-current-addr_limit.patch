Subject: [Variant 1/Spectre-v1] arm64: uaccess: Prevent speculative use of the current addr_limit

From: Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>


Commit c2f0ad4fc089 upstream.

A mispredicted conditional call to set_fs could result in the wrong
addr_limit being forwarded under speculation to a subsequent access_ok
check, potentially forming part of a spectre-v1 attack using uaccess
routines.

This patch prevents this forwarding from taking place, but putting heavy
barriers in set_fs after writing the addr_limit.
