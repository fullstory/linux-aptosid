Subject: [Variant 3/Meltdown] arm64: Kconfig: Add CONFIG_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0

From: Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>


Commit 084eb77cd3a8 upstream.

Add a Kconfig entry to control use of the entry trampoline, which allows
us to unmap the kernel whilst running in userspace and improve the
robustness of KASLR.
