Subject: [Variant 2/Spectre-v2] arm64: Branch predictor hardening for Cavium ThunderX2

From: Jayachandran C <jnair@caviumnetworks.com>


Commit f3d795d9b360 upstream.

Use PSCI based mitigation for speculative execution attacks targeting
the branch predictor. We use the same mechanism as the one used for
Cortex-A CPUs, we expect the PSCI version call to have a side effect
of clearing the BTBs.
