Subject: 8021q: fix a memory leak for VLAN 0 device

From: Cong Wang <xiyou.wangcong@gmail.com>


[ Upstream commit 78bbb15f2239bc8e663aa20bbe1987c91a0b75f6 ]

A vlan device with vid 0 is allow to creat by not able to be fully
cleaned up by unregister_vlan_dev() which checks for vlan_id!=0.

Also, VLAN 0 is probably not a valid number and it is kinda
"reserved" for HW accelerating devices, but it is probably too
late to reject it from creation even if makes sense. Instead,
just remove the check in unregister_vlan_dev().

Fixes: ad1afb003939 ("vlan_dev: VLAN 0 should be treated as "no vlan tag" (802.1p packet)")
