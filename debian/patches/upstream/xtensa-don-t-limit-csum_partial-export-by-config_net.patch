Subject: xtensa: don't limit csum_partial export by CONFIG_NET

From: Max Filippov <jcmvbkbc@gmail.com>

commit 7f81e55c737a8fa82c71f290945d729a4902f8d2 upstream.

csum_partial and csum_partial_copy_generic are defined unconditionally
and are available even when CONFIG_NET is disabled. They are used not
only by the network drivers, but also by scsi and media.
Don't limit these functions export by CONFIG_NET.
