Subject: [Variant 3/Meltdown] arm64: use RET instruction for exiting the trampoline

From: Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>


Commit be04a6d1126b upstream.

Speculation attacks against the entry trampoline can potentially resteer
the speculative instruction stream through the indirect branch and into
arbitrary gadgets within the kernel.

This patch defends against these attacks by forcing a misprediction
through the return stack: a dummy BL instruction loads an entry into
the stack, so that the predicted program flow of the subsequent RET
instruction is to a branch-to-self instruction which is finally resolved
as a branch to the kernel vectors with speculation suppressed.
