Subject: btrfs: resume qgroup rescan on rw remount

From: Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.de>

commit 6c6b5a39c4bf3dbd8cf629c9f5450e983c19dbb9 upstream.

Several distributions mount the "proper root" as ro during initrd and
then remount it as rw before pivot_root(2). Thus, if a rescan had been
aborted by a previous shutdown, the rescan would never be resumed.

This issue would manifest itself as several btrfs ioctl(2)s causing the
entire machine to hang when btrfs_qgroup_wait_for_completion was hit
(due to the fs_info->qgroup_rescan_running flag being set but the rescan
itself not being resumed). Notably, Docker's btrfs storage driver makes
regular use of BTRFS_QUOTA_CTL_DISABLE and BTRFS_IOC_QUOTA_RESCAN_WAIT
(causing this problem to be manifested on boot for some machines).
