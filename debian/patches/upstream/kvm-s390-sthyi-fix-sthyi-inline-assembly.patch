Subject: KVM: s390: sthyi: fix sthyi inline assembly

From: Heiko Carstens <heiko.carstens@de.ibm.com>

commit 4a4eefcd0e49f9f339933324c1bde431186a0a7d upstream.

The sthyi inline assembly misses register r3 within the clobber
list. The sthyi instruction will always write a return code to
register "R2+1", which in this case would be r3. Due to that we may
have register corruption and see host crashes or data corruption
depending on how gcc decided to allocate and use registers during
compile time.

Fixes: 95ca2cb57985 ("KVM: s390: Add sthyi emulation")
