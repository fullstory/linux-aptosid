+ * found stable (i.e. pointing to a pte). And we're returning a none
+ * pmdval if the low part of the pmd is none. In some cases the high
+ * and low part of the pmdval returned may not be consistent if THP is
+ * enabled (the low part may point to previously mapped hugepage,
+ * while the high part may point to a more recently mapped hugepage),
