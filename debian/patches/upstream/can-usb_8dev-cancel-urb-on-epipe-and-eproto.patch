Subject: can: usb_8dev: cancel urb on -EPIPE and -EPROTO

From: Martin Kelly <mkelly@xevo.com>

commit 12147edc434c9e4c7c2f5fee2e5519b2e5ac34ce upstream.

In mcba_usb, we have observed that when you unplug the device, the driver will
endlessly resubmit failing URBs, which can cause CPU stalls. This issue
is fixed in mcba_usb by catching the codes seen on device disconnect
(-EPIPE and -EPROTO).

This driver also resubmits in the case of -EPIPE and -EPROTO, so fix it
in the same way.
