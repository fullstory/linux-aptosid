Subject: x86/cpu/AMD: Fix cpu_llc_id for AMD Fam17h systems

From: Yazen Ghannam <Yazen.Ghannam@amd.com>

commit b0b6e86846093c5f8820386bc01515f857dd8faa upstream.

cpu_llc_id (Last Level Cache ID) derivation on AMD Fam17h has an
underflow bug when extracting the socket_id value. It starts from 0
so subtracting 1 from it will result in an invalid value. This breaks
scheduling topology later on since the cpu_llc_id will be incorrect.

For example, the the cpu_llc_id of the *other* CPU in the loops in
set_cpu_sibling_map() underflows and we're generating the funniest
thread_siblings masks and then when I run 8 threads of nbench, they get
spread around the LLC domains in a very strange pattern which doesn't
give you the normal scheduling spread one would expect for performance.

Other things like EDAC use cpu_llc_id so they will be b0rked too.

So, the APIC ID is preset in APICx020 for bits 3 and above: they contain
the core complex, node and socket IDs.

The LLC is at the core complex level so we can find a unique cpu_llc_id
by right shifting the APICID by 3 because then the least significant bit
will be the Core Complex ID.
