#    mac80211: dont use interface indices in drivers
#
#    This patch gets rid of the if_id stuff where possible in favour of
#    a new per-virtual-interface structure "struct ieee80211_vif". This
#    structure is located at the end of the per-interface structure and
#    contains a variable length driver-use data area.
#
#    This has two advantages:
#     * removes the need to look up interfaces by if_id, this is better
#       for working with network namespaces and performance
#     * allows drivers to store and retrieve per-interface data without
#       having to allocate own lists/hash tables
